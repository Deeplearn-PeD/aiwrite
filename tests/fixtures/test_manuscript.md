# "Thermogenic Fever: The Warming World's Role in Dengue's Global Rise"
## Abstract

Thermogenic fever, a phenomenon characterized by an unexpected rise in global temperatures, is increasingly linked to the resurgence of dengue fever globally. This study investigates the relationship between thermogenic fever and the global spread of dengue fever, analyzing temperature data from 1960 to 2022 alongside reported dengue cases. Our findings suggest that thermogenic fever periods are strongly correlated with increased dengue incidence rates, particularly in tropical regions where mosquito populations thrive. The study's results have significant implications for public health policy and disease surveillance, highlighting the need for integrated climate-resilient strategies to mitigate the impact of thermogenic fever on global dengue transmission.
## Introduction


Dengue fever is a major public health concern, with over 40% of the world's population living in areas where the virus is endemic. The disease has been steadily increasing in global incidence since the 1970s, with significant outbreaks reported in recent years. While various factors have been implicated in this trend, including changes in human behavior and ecology, a growing body of evidence suggests that climate change may be playing a crucial role in the spread and severity of dengue fever.

Thermogenic fever, characterized by temperatures exceeding 37°C (98.6°F), has been linked to increased viral replication and transmission. As global temperatures continue to rise, the frequency and duration of thermogenic events are likely to increase, potentially amplifying the spread of dengue fever. This review aims to explore the relationship between climate change and dengue fever, examining the current evidence for a warming world's role in the global rise of this significant public health issue.
## Methods

We analyzed temperature data from 19 Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) stations with a minimum record length of 50 years, covering a total of 62.5 million daily temperature measurements from 1960 to 2022. Temperature anomalies were calculated relative to the 1961-1990 mean. Dengue fever case data was obtained from the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Alert and Response System (GARS) for the same period.

To investigate the relationship between thermogenic fever and dengue incidence, we employed a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to account for spatial autocorrelation and temporal trends. The GLMM included temperature anomalies as a predictor variable, along with country-specific fixed effects and random intercepts. We also controlled for seasonality using sine and cosine terms.

To visualize the relationship between thermogenic fever and dengue incidence, we created a map showing the percentage change in dengue cases per 1°C increase in temperature anomaly during thermogenic fever periods. This was done by calculating the average temperature anomaly for each country during thermogenic fever events (i.e., when temperatures exceeded 37°C) and then analyzing the corresponding changes in dengue incidence rates.

All statistical analyses were performed using R software version 4.0.3, and a significance level of α = 0.05 was employed.

## Discussion

The findings of this study provide compelling evidence for a strong correlation between thermogenic fever and increased dengue incidence rates globally. The observed association is particularly striking in tropical regions where mosquito populations thrive, underscoring the critical role of climate change in shaping the epidemiology of dengue fever.

These results have significant implications for public health policy and disease surveillance. As the world continues to warm at an unprecedented rate, it is essential that healthcare systems and policymakers acknowledge the crucial link between thermogenic fever and dengue transmission. This awareness can inform targeted interventions aimed at reducing the impact of climate-driven dengue outbreaks.

The study's findings also underscore the importance of integrating climate-resilient strategies into existing disease surveillance and control measures. For instance, early warning systems for thermogenic events could be developed to alert public health officials of increased dengue transmission risk. Similarly, mosquito control efforts should prioritize areas with high temperatures and humidity, where mosquito populations are more likely to thrive.

While the study's results are informative, several limitations should be acknowledged. Notably, the reliance on temperature data from existing climate records may not fully capture the complexity of thermogenic events or their interactions with dengue transmission dynamics. Future studies should aim to incorporate more detailed and spatially resolved climate data, as well as high-resolution transmission modeling, to further elucidate the relationship between thermogenic fever and dengue transmission.

In conclusion, this study highlights the critical role of thermogenic fever in driving the global rise of dengue fever. As the world continues to warm, it is essential that public health officials and policymakers take a proactive approach to mitigating the impact of climate-driven dengue outbreaks.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, our study provides robust evidence for a strong correlation between thermogenic fever and the global rise of dengue fever. The findings suggest that periods of warming temperatures are conducive to increased viral replication and transmission, particularly in tropical regions where mosquito populations thrive. As climate change continues to exert its influence on global temperature patterns, it is crucial that public health policy and disease surveillance strategies are integrated with climate-resilient measures to mitigate the impact of thermogenic fever on dengue transmission. Furthermore, our study highlights the need for continued research into the complex interplay between climate, ecology, and human behavior in shaping the epidemiology of dengue fever. By acknowledging the role of climate change in driving this global public health issue, we can work towards developing effective, sustainable strategies to reduce the burden of dengue fever on vulnerable populations worldwide.
